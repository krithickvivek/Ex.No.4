**DATE:**  
**REGISTER NUMBER: 212223240075**  

## Aim  
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone.  

In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.  

We consider **Case Study 2** with *Comparative Analysis Prompt, Universal Prompt, Structured Prompt Refinements, and Prompt Size Limitations*.  


## Explanation  
We take **one use case from Unit 5** and generate the report using **Unit 2 prompt types**.  

**Use Case Selected:**  
The **manufacturing industry** is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation.  

- The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance.  
- The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.  

**Target Audience:**  
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like **automotive, electronics, and food processing**, where automation can significantly improve productivity.  

**Main Objectives:**  
- Improve production efficiency by **30%**.  
- Minimize machinery downtime with **predictive maintenance**.  
- Enable **real-time monitoring** and **remote control** of manufacturing systems.  
- Reduce **energy consumption** by optimizing processes.  

## Procedure  

### Step 1: Define the Scenario and Use Case  
- **Scenario:** Automation in manufacturing through IoT and predictive maintenance.  
- **Use Case:** Improving efficiency, monitoring, and predictive alerts.  

### Step 2: Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect  

#### 1. **Idea Generation Prompts**  
**Prompt:**  
 “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?”  

**Generated Ideas:**  
- Sensors for **real-time monitoring** of equipment performance.  
- **Predictive maintenance alerts** to anticipate equipment failures.  
- **Energy usage optimization** by automating switching of machines ON/OFF based on demand.  
- **Cloud-based dashboards** for remote monitoring and control of machinery.  

#### 2. **Persona and Context Prompts**  
**Prompt:**  
 “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?”  

**Generated Context:**  
- The user interface should be **intuitive**, showing real-time machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.  
- The system should convey **reliability** and **ease of use**, requiring minimal training for operators.  
- Managers should have **analytical insights** for decision-making (production trends, downtime causes, energy reports).  

#### 3. **Comparative Analysis Prompt**  
**Prompt:**  
 “Compare automation through IoT-enabled systems with traditional manual monitoring in terms of efficiency, cost, and downtime reduction.”  

**Generated Comparison:**  
- **Traditional Monitoring:** High manpower cost, slower response to breakdowns, no predictive insights.  
- **IoT Automation:** Automated alerts, predictive failure detection, improved energy optimization, and significant efficiency gains.  


#### 4. **Universal Prompt**  
**Prompt:**  
 “Summarize the impact of predictive maintenance in one universal statement.”  

**Generated Summary:**  
- Predictive maintenance transforms manufacturing by **minimizing downtime, reducing costs, and extending machine lifespan**.  


#### 5. **Structured Prompt Refinements**  
**Prompt:**  
 “List the steps involved in implementing IoT-based automation for manufacturing efficiency.”  

**Generated Steps:**  
1. Install IoT-enabled **sensors** on machinery.  
2. Collect and process **real-time performance data**.  
3. Integrate with a **cloud-based dashboard** for monitoring.  
4. Implement **predictive maintenance algorithms**.  
5. Automate energy and production workflows.  
6. Provide a **user-friendly interface** for operators and managers.  


#### 6. **Prompt Size Limitations**  
**Observation:**  
- Short prompts → Generate **broad, general** ideas (e.g., “Improve efficiency”).  
- Longer prompts with context → Generate **specific, actionable** insights (e.g., “Use predictive maintenance with IoT sensors to minimize downtime”).  

## Result  
- The various types of prompts such as **Comparative Analysis, Universal Prompt, Structured Prompt Refinement, and Prompt Size Limitation** were successfully applied.  
- A **complete report** was generated for the given **Unit 5 use case** using **Unit 2 prompt types**.  

**Therefore, the prompts were executed successfully.** ✅
